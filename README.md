# Code Generator
This script allows a user to input words into 4 different word banks. The word banks are then permeated to produce every combination of words while maintaining the order. This list of combinations is printed line-by-line in the terminal.

This is a proof of concept and can be used as a script or injected into a codebase as a tool. 👨‍💻👩‍💻
